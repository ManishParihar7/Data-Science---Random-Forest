# Data-Science---Random-Forest
# Fraud Detection and Sales Prediction Models

This repository contains two machine learning projects. The first project is about fraud detection using decision trees, and the second project focuses on predicting sales using a Random Forest classifier. Here's an overview of both projects:

## Fraud Detection (Project 1)

### Problem Statement
Use decision trees to prepare a model on fraud data treating those who have taxable income less than or equal to $30,000 as "Risky" and others as "Good."

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Steps:
1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering to create a new "Fraud_Check" column
3. Label encoding for categorical features
4. Model building using Decision Trees and Random Forest
5. Model evaluation and interpretation
6. Creating a confusion matrix and classification report
7. Data visualization for feature importance

## Sales Prediction (Project 2)

### Problem Statement
A cloth manufacturing company is interested in determining the attributes that cause high sales. We build a Random Forest classifier with the target variable "Sales" (categorized) and all other variables as independent variables.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing, including categorizing the "Sales" variable
2. Data exploration and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Label encoding for categorical features
5. Model building using Random Forest
6. Model evaluation
7. Data visualization for feature importance
8. Creating a confusion matrix and classification report

## Getting Started

You can run these projects by cloning the repository and installing the required libraries. Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations and code.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install them using `pip install`.

## Acknowledgments

- These projects were created for educational purposes to learn about decision trees and Random Forest classifiers in Python.
- The datasets used are for demonstration and practice. You can replace them with your own datasets for real-world applications.
